## AI Model  

### Data  

The model was trained on images representing the seven plastic resin codes. The dataset uses images from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piaoya/plastic-recycling-codes), which is also available in `ml/seven_plastics`.  

### Training  

The model is built using [TensorFlow's EfficientNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/efficientnet_v2/EfficientNetV2B0) for transfer learning, accelerating the learning process. Training was conducted on a GPU-powered machine using Python. The training script is available in `ml/train.py`, where various architectures and parameters were tested before finalizing the model.  

### Prediction  

To integrate real-time predictions with the front end, the model was converted for compatibility with [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js). Using [Web Workers](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/ecosnap/blob/main/components/Worker.js), predictions run smoothly without affecting the appâ€™s performance.  

When an image is uploaded, the app processes it into a tensor, and the model predicts the most probable resin code, displaying relevant recycling information.  

### Feedback  

To improve accuracy, users can provide feedback on incorrect predictions. This benefits both the user and the model:  

1. Users receive correct recycling information.  
2. Model performance in real-world scenarios is monitored.  
3. New data (if permitted) helps refine future versions.  

Although the feedback feature is present in the front end, it isn't connected to a backend to keep the app lightweight and privacy-friendly.
